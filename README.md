# Idolize v2

Idolize v2 is a work-in-progress web application that I am using to get hands-on experience and learn best practices of full-stack development. 
The backend is built with Django, using the same backend from my Idolize v1 project, while the frontend is a React application programmed in TypeScript.
The purpose of this project is to eventually create an actual product to be usable by real users. 


## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django, Python
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (via Django ORM)
- **API**: Django REST Framework (DRF)

## Features

- Search and view idol profiles from the database via the API
- Type-safe frontend with TypeScript
